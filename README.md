# Weaverse Claude Code Toolkit

This repository is a toolkit of Claude-based developer utilities: re-usable subagents, plus command/workflow templates that orchestrate them.

### What’s inside
- `agents/` — Claude subagent specifications (prompts and role definitions) such as code-review-specialist.md, debug-specialist.md, docs-writer.md, etc.
- `commands/` — runnable command/workflow templates and invocation patterns (commit, create-pr, fix-pr, format, handoff, review-changes, review-code, ultrathink). These files describe how to orchestrate the agents in developer workflows.
